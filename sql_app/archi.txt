 Following is the architecture of sql: 
 .
 └── sql_app
    ├── __init__.py    
    ├── crud.py        
    ├── database.py    
    ├── main.py        
    ├── models.py      
    └── schemas.py     

 Basically, the function of model.py and schemas.py is nearly similar. 
 But the difference is: model is the model of sqlalchemy, and the schmas is for pydantic.
